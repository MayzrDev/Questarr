## 2025-12-12 - Initial Enhancement: ARIA Labels for Icon Buttons

**Learning:** This codebase contains several icon-only buttons without `aria-label` attributes, making them inaccessible to screen reader users. This is a common accessibility issue that can be easily resolved.

**Action:** Prioritize adding descriptive `aria-label`s to all icon-only buttons to ensure they are understandable to users of assistive technologies. This will be the first micro-UX improvement.
